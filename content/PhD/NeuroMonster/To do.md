# Urgent
- [x] Finish cleaning the new word level dataset
- [x] Run BERT and GPT2 on both datasets including univariate
- [x] Make description and correlations plots for the new word level dataset and relative clause
- [x] Describe methods (prompt?)
- [x] Maybe Roberta and Mistral
 * [x] Abstract Rework: Condense the abstract to get to the main points faster, using bullet points to highlight the problem (feature representation in LLMs/brains), the issue with standard decoding, and your proposed new method.
 * [x] Refine MLEM Description: Rephrase the advantages of MLEM, emphasizing its theoretical framework encompassing RSA/FR-RSA and its ability to model feature interactions with an SPD constraint.
 * [x] Update Titles: Change the "One advantage over FR-RSA" title to "Simulations with Toy Data" and the "Processing profile..." title to "Application to a large language model."
 * [x] Add Summary Sentences: Include bolded summary sentences at the bottom of both the "Simulations with Toy Data" and "Application to a large language model" sections.
 * [x] Evaluate Disentanglement Panel: Determine if the disentanglement panel is necessary; consider replacing it with a figure comparing multi vs. univariate performance.
 * [x] Format References: Reduce reference font size and ensure full information (year, journal) is included.
 * [x] Acknowledge Authors: Add all author names, with an asterisk for equal contribution for Emmanuel and Yair.
 * [x] Clarify Plot: Explain that each vertical in the bottom-left plot represents a "unit" and consider changing the title to "Units show specificity to different linguistic features."
 * [x] Adjust Formatting: Start a new line before "They are multivariate..." and, if applicable, place the MLEM advantage points about modeling feature interactions and SPD constraint side-by-side.
