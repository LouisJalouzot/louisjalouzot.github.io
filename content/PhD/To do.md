# Past
## [[Reviews]]
- [x] Write email to confirm everything
### [[Optimizing fMRI Data Acquisition for Decoding Natural Speech with Limited Participants]]
- [x] Drop Fig 7
- [x] Update the others
- [x] Leila Wehbe et al. 2014 fMRI decoding retrieval, baseline? No, encoding paper
- [x] Fig 1: 0 at 100 + axis break
- [x] Fig 6: Switch to $\sigma$ + full candidates + raw values on plot (?)
- [x] ~~Figure comparing multiple LLMs~~
- [x] ~~Baseline "Ridge"~~
- [x] ~~Pereira/Fedorenko 2018, background?~~

### [[Metric-Learning Encoding Models Identify Processing Profiles of Linguistic Features in BERTâ€™s Representations]]
- [x] For annoying points on writing, point to lines already answering the point
- [x] Figure with negligible weights out of the diagonal (since we crafted the dataset to include *interaction* features)
- [x] Tell that we tried GPT2, problem of sentence representations, bad with causal LLMs, tried on last token got weird results
- [x] Figure 6 for other subjects
- [x] Launch computation
- [x] Show that Figure 7 was cherry picked by showing plot of rank % tr
