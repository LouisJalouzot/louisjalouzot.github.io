This paper introduces "behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity" (BTSP) as a novel form of synaptic potentiation in hippocampal area CA1 that underlies the formation of place fields. Unlike traditional Hebbian plasticity, which relies on causality and repetition over milliseconds, BTSP allows for potentiation of synaptic inputs that occur seconds before and after complex spiking, even if they are not directly causal or coincident with postsynaptic activation. This potentiation can produce new place fields in vivo in a single trial.

Key findings and characteristics of BTSP:

- **Discovery in CA1 Place Fields:** Place fields in hippocampal area CA1 are generated by a synaptic potentiation mechanism distinct from Hebbian plasticity. This process involves dendritic Ca2+ plateau potentials driving an increase in the weights of excitatory synaptic inputs, leading to the rapid formation of new CA1 place fields in a spatial environment.
    
- **Seconds-Long Time Scale:** Intracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in head-fixed mice revealed that plateau potential initiation (naturally occurring or experimentally induced) produced a ramp-like depolarization of membrane potential (Vm​ ramp) that drove place-field firing in subsequent trials. This Vm​ ramp extended seconds back in time to locations where the postsynaptic cell did not initially exhibit action potential firing or somatic depolarization. This suggests a learning rule spanning seconds rather than tens of milliseconds. The width of the Vm​ ramp was directly related to the running speed of the mouse during the induction trial, confirming a plasticity rule operating on a seconds-long time scale.
    
- **Asymmetric Plasticity Kernel:** Deconvolution of Vm​ ramps showed an asymmetric plasticity kernel that was two orders of magnitude longer than expected for standard plasticity, with a rise time extending for approximately 3 seconds and a decay time of about 2 seconds. This allows potentiation of inputs not directly causal or temporally contiguous with postsynaptic activation.
    
- **Biophysically Detailed Model:** A biophysical model was developed, suggesting that a local signal generated at each activated synapse overlaps with a more global signal produced by dendritic plateau potentials, determining the degree of synaptic weight change. This model reproduced the asymmetric, long-duration plasticity observed experimentally.
    
- **Reproducibility in Hippocampal Slices:** BTSP was replicated in hippocampal slice preparations using five pairings of subthreshold presynaptic activity and calcium plateau potentials. This resulted in a substantial, approximately threefold potentiation upon coincident stimulation, decaying gradually and remaining significant for nearly 4 seconds backward (presynaptic before postsynaptic) and over 2 seconds forward (postsynaptic before presynaptic). This potentiation stabilized minutes after induction and persisted throughout the recordings.
    
- **Mechanism and Pharmacological Sensitivity:** The study indicates a predominantly postsynaptic mechanism for BTSP. BTSP was found to be sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade by D-aminophosphovalerate (D-APV) and L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine, both of which significantly reduced potentiation. Importantly, these blockers did not reduce the duration of the induction plateau potentials. _In vivo_ application of nimodipine also reduced the amplitude of the Vm​ ramp induced by plateau potential initiation, directly linking BTSP to place-field formation in CA1.
    
- **Implications:** BTSP can rapidly store entire behavioral sequences within synaptic weights, generating predictive place cell activity that peaks before the actual induction location. This form of plasticity is proposed to act as an instructive signal for learning, differing from autonomous or correlative learning. It offers a plausible biophysical basis for various types of learning, including episodic memory and trace conditioning, and may alleviate the need for prolonged internal stimulus representations.
