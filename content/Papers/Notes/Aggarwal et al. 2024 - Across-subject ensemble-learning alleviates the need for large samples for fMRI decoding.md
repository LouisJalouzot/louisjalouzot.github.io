> > Decoding cognitive states from functional magnetic resonance imaging is central to understanding the functional organization of the brain. Within-subject decoding avoids between-subject correspondence problems but requires large sample sizes to make accurate predictions; obtaining such large sample sizes is both challenging and expensive.

> > try [19]. It entails acquiring brain signals using neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and then training a classifier to learn the mapping from brain signals to cognitive states. However, given that acquiring such data is expensive and time-consuming, the number of features (voxels) is usually much large
