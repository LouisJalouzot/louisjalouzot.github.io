> > various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another

> > we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley A dditive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction

> > Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties
