> [!abstract] Abstract
> How the brain mentally sorts a series of items in a specific order within working memory (WM) remains largely unknown. We investigated mental sorting using high-throughput electrophysiological recordings in the frontal cortex of macaque monkeys, who memorized and sorted spatial sequences in forward or backward orders according to visual cues. We discovered that items at each ordinal rank in WM were encoded in separate rank-WM subspaces and then, depending on cues, were maintained or reordered between the subspaces, accompanied by two extra temporary subspaces in two operation steps. Furthermore, the cue activity served as an indexical signal to trigger sorting processes. Thus, we propose a complete conceptual framework, where the neural landscape transitions in frontal neural states underlie the symbolic system for mental programming of sequence WM.

The monkeys used separate neural work subspaces to temporarily store and then manipulate information. These computations were multistepped and occurred both in serial and in parallel. This was possible because the neurons showed mixed selectivity and responded to multiple cue features. These findings are an important step in understanding the neural mechanisms of reasoning and planning. —Peter Stern

>               One of the most intriguing puzzles in cognitive neuroscience is understanding the neural mechanisms behind mental operations. For instance, when you learn a simple algorithmic operation, such as fractions, you not only assign arbitrary shapes “–” or “/” to the operations but also decompose the program into relatively simpler primitives (e.g., numerator and denominator) and their relationships. This mystery of mental programming was first identified by Alan Turing as the basis of all cognition. The main challenge that we face today is understanding how our brain decomposes complex programs into distinct neural steps or primitives in working memory (WM).

>               WM refers to our ability to temporarily maintain and manipulate information, which is foundational to the organization of goal-directed behavior. Although the nature of WM maintenance has been the focus of WM research in the past decades, WM manipulation or volitional control is more complex and has received less attention. The control process is what makes WM distinct and sets it apart from short-term memory. Previous human imaging studies have shown that the frontal cortex was highly involved in WM control. However, the neural dynamics and computational mechanisms supporting the control are not understood. We aimed to characterize these neural computations in the frontal cortex of nonhuman primates.

>               We trained two monkeys to perform a visuospatial delayed sequence-sorting task. On each trial, spatial sequences with a length of two or three items were visually presented during the sample period while the monkeys maintained fixation on the dot at the center of the screen. Each sequence item was randomly drawn (without replacement) from one of the six spatial locations of a hexagonal ring. The monkeys had to maintain the sequential locations in memory during the first delay period. Depending on the visual cue (e.g., two different pictures), the monkeys were required to either keep or reverse the ordinal rank of sequences and then hold the resulting sequence WM during the second delay period for later recall. Additionally, the monkeys not only had to learn mental sorting but also were required to gradually associate discrete visual cues with different response rules, converting the mental sorting into distinct symbols.
>               In behavior, the monkeys could mentally repeat or reverse sequences on a trial-by-trial basis and report them by making appropriate sequential touches to the on-screen locations. Electrophysiological recordings in the frontal cortex showed that spatial locations at each rank in sequence WM during the first delay were encoded in the separate rank-WM subspaces and then maintained or swapped after rule cues during the second delay. The mental sorting, indexed by the neural activities in the independent visual-cue subspace, was achieved by using two extra temporary subspaces in two parallel operation steps. The activities identified in the subspaces faithfully predicted monkeys’ recalled item or order information, even in single-error trials.

>               The representations of mental programming in sequence WM are composed of neural activities and their dynamics in the separate subspaces of rule-cue, rank-WM, and temporary. These factorized neural components and their interactive dynamics in the frontal circuits are precisely controlled to the proper subspace and manipulated at a specific moment on the basis of internal (long-term memory) or external (sensory) cues. WM control not only involves an association between sensory and motor but also engages in creating and rotating or reordering factorized neural ensembles in memories or actions. Extra temporary subspace or dimensionality is necessary for information exchange or asynchronous programming. Furthermore, creating a mapping or indexical relation between abstract algorithmic operations and their associated labels is essential because the labels can drive humans or animals into representational redescription and help them organize their mental space, projecting back onto the external world. Thus, this comprehensive understanding of the neural landscape transitions in frontal neural states underpins the symbolic system for mental programming of sequence WM, marking a substantial stride in our knowledge of the higher cognitive process in the brain.

Spatial locations in each rank were encoded in separate rank subspaces, depending on rule cues, and were swapped between the subspaces by using two extra temporary subspaces in parallel.
