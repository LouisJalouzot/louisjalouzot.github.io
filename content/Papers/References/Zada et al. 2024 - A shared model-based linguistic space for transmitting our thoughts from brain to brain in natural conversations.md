extra: "TLDR: A model-based coupling framework that aligns brain activity in both speaker and listener to a shared embedding space from a large language model (LLM) is developed, indicating that the contextual embeddings learned by LLMs can serve as an explicit numerical model of the shared, context-rich meaning space humans use to communicate their thoughts to one another."
