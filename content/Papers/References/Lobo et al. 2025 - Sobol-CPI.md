> [!abstract] Abstract
> Conditional Permutation Importance (CPI) has been recently introduced for Variable Importance analysis with good empirical results. In this work, we first provide theoretical guarantees for CPI. We establish a double robustness property to detect null covariates, making it a suitable model for variable selection. We then present a modified and still computationally efficient version, Sobol-CPI, that aims to estimate a well-known variable importance measure, the Total Sobol Index (TSI). We prove that it is nonparametrically efficient, and we provide a procedure to control the type-I error. Through numerical experiments, we show that Sobol-CPI preserves the double robustness property in practice.
