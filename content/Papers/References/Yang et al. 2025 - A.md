> Abstract
>           Recent recordings from the hippocampus of the human brain suggest that after a few presentations of sequences of unrelated natural images, correlations between emergent neural codes encode the sequential structure of these sequences. We show that this learning process, which is consistent with experimental data on BTSP (Behavioral Time Scale Synaptic Plasticity), creates a cognitive map that enables online-generation of plans for moving to any given goal, both in spatial environments and in abstract graphs. Furthermore, the resulting neural circuits and plasticity rules provide a biologically plausible implementation of Successor Relation based Reinforcement Learning. In addition, this brain-derived approach for learning cognitive maps provides a blueprint for implementing autonomous learning through on-chip plasticity in energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware.
