> [!abstract] Abstract
> A fundamental question in neurolinguistics concerns the brain regions involved in syntactic and semantic processing during speech comprehension, both at the lexical (word processing) and supra-lexical levels (sentence and discourse processing). To what extent are these regions separated or intertwined? To address this question, we trained a lexical language model, Glove, and a supra-lexical language model, GPT-2, on a text corpus from which we selectively removed either syntactic or semantic information. We then assessed to what extent these information-restricted models were able to predict the time-courses of fMRI signal of humans listening to naturalistic text. We also manipulated the size of contextual information provided to GPT-2 in order to determine the windows of integration of brain regions involved in supra-lexical processing. Our analyses show that, while most brain regions involved in language are sensitive to both syntactic and semantic variables, the relative magnitudes of these effects vary a lot across these regions. Furthermore, we found an asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres, with semantic and syntactic processing being more dissociated in the left hemisphere than in the right, and the left and right hemispheres showing respectively greater sensitivity to short and long contexts. The use of information-restricted NLP models thus shed new light on the spatial organization of syntactic processing, semantic processing and compositionality.
