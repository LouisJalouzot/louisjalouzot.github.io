> [!abstract] Abstract
> Natural language syntax can serve as a major test for how to integrate two infamously distinct frameworks: symbolic representations and connectionist neural networks. Building on a recent neurocomputational architecture for syntax (ROSE), I discuss the prospects of reconciling the neural code for hierarchical 'vertical' syntax with linear and predictive 'horizontal' processes via a hybrid neurosymbolic model. I argue that the former can be accounted for via the higher levels of ROSE in terms of vertical phrase structure representations, while the latter can explain horizontal forms of linguistic information via the tuning of the lower levels to statistical and perceptual inferences. One prediction of this is that artificial language models will contribute to the cognitive neuroscience of horizontal morphosyntax, but much less so to hierarchically compositional structures. I claim that this perspective helps resolve many current tensions in the literature. Options for integrating these two neural codes are discussed, with particular emphasis on how predictive coding mechanisms can serve as interfaces between symbolic oscillatory phase codes and population codes for the statistics of linearized aspects of syntax. Lastly, I provide a neurosymbolic mathematical model for how to inject symbolic representations into a neural regime encoding lexico-semantic statistical features.
