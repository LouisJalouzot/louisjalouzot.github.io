> [!abstract] Abstract
> Can active inference model consciousness? We offer three conditions implying that it can. The first condition is the simulation of a reality or generative world model, which determines what can be known or acted upon; namely an epistemic field. The second is inferential competition to enter the world model. Only the inferences that coherently reduce long-term uncertainty win, evincing a selection for consciousness that we call Bayesian binding. The third is epistemic depth, which is the recurrent sharing of the Bayesian beliefs throughout the system. Due to this recursive loop â€” in a hierarchical system (such as a brain) â€” the world model contains the knowledge that it exists. This is distinct from self-consciousness, because the world model knows itself non-locally and continuously evidences this knowing (i.e., field-evidencing). Formally, we propose a hyper-model for precision-control across the entire hierarchy, whose latent states (or parameters) encode and control the overall structure and weighting rules for all layers of inference. This Beautiful Loop Theory is deeply revealing about meditation, psychedelic, and altered states, minimal phenomenal experience, and provides a new vision for conscious artificial intelligence.
