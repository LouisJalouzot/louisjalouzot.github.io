> [!abstract] Abstract
> Humpback whale song is a culturally transmitted behavior. Human language, which is also culturally transmitted, has statistically coherent parts whose frequency distribution follows a power law. These properties facilitate learning and may therefore arise because of their contribution to the faithful transmission of language over multiple cultural generations. If so, we would expect to find them in other culturally transmitted systems. In this study, we applied methods based on infant speech segmentation to 8 years of humpback recordings, uncovering in whale song the same statistical structure that is a hallmark of human language. This commonality, in two evolutionarily distant species, points to the role of learning and cultural transmission in the emergence of properties thought to be unique to human language.

>               All human languages follow a particular distribution of words known as the Zipf distribution. This distribution pertains to the frequency of relative word use and is believed to reflect cultural transmission of language. This pattern has also been found in infants during the beginnings of language production. The approach used to study these preverbal patterns allows for the study of songs and calls in other species.

They found clear evidence of a Zipf distribution in this song, as well as other hallmarks of human language such as statistical coherence and brevity of subsequences. â€”Sacha Vignieri
