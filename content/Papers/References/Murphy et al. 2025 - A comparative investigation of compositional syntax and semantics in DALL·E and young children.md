> [!abstract] Abstract
> In this study we compared how well DALLÂ·E 2 and DALLÂ·E 3 visually represented the meaning of linguistic prompts also given to young children in comprehension tests. Sentences representing fundamental components of grammatical knowledge were selected from assessment tests used with several hundred English-speaking children aged 2â€“7 years for whom we had collected original item-level data. DALLÂ·E 2 was given these prompts five times to generate 20 cartoons per item, for 9 adult judges to score. Results revealed no conditions in which DALLÂ·E 2-generated images that matched the semantic accuracy of children, even at the youngest age (2 years). DALLÂ·E 2 failed to assign the appropriate roles in reversible forms; it fared poorly on negation despite an easier contrastive prompt than the children received; it often assigned the adjective to the wrong noun; it ignored implicit agents in passives. As a follow-up study, we queried DALLÂ·E 3 to generate 8 images each of the same prompts. This demonstrated a consistent failure to compositionally represent syntactic structure (in particular for negation and reversible prepositional phrases), albeit with some improvements from DALLÂ·E 2. This work points to a clear absence of compositional sentence representations for both DALLÂ·E 2 and DALLÂ·E 3.
