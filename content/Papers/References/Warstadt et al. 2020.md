# BLiMP: The Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs for English

[PDF file](/Papers/PDFs/Warstadt%20et%20al.%202020%20-%20BLiMP:%20The%20Benchmark%20of%20Linguistic%20Minimal%20Pairs%20for%20English.pdf)

> [!abstract] Abstract
> We introduce The Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (BLiMP),
>               1
>               a challenge set for evaluating the linguistic knowledge of language models (LMs) on major grammatical phenomena in English. BLiMP consists of 67 individual datasets, each containing 1,000 minimal pairsâ€”that is, pairs of minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability and isolate specific phenomenon in syntax, morphology, or semantics. We generate the data according to linguist-crafted grammar templates, and human aggregate agreement with the labels is 96.4%. We evaluate n-gram, LSTM, and Transformer (GPT-2 and Transformer-XL) LMs by observing whether they assign a higher probability to the acceptable sentence in each minimal pair. We find that state-of-the-art models identify morphological contrasts related to agreement reliably, but they struggle with some subtle semantic and syntactic phenomena, such as negative polarity items and extraction islands.
