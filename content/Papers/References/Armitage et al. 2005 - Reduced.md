>               when the predictor variables are highly correlated. These include inflation of standard errors of the regression coefficients and ill‐conditioned covariance matrices of the predictors. Historically,

>               regression have been employed in these situations. With the advent of more powerful computers, it has become a common practice to obtain the principal components of the predictors variables and use them as predictors. However, there is no guarantee that the largest components will be good predictors.
