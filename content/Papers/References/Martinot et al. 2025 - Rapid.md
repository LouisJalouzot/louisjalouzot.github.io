> [!abstract] Abstract
> Preventing gender disparities in mathematics is a worldwide preoccupation1,2. In infancy and early childhood, boys and girls exhibit similar core knowledge of number and space3â€“8. Gender disparities in maths are, therefore, thought to primarily reflect an internalization of the sociocultural stereotype that â€˜girls are bad at mathsâ€™. However, where, when and how widely this stereotype becomes entrenched remains uncertain. Here, we report the results of a 4-year longitudinal assessment of language and mathematical performance of all French first and second graders (2,653,082 children). Boys and girls exhibited very similar maths scores upon school entry, but a gender gap in favour of boys became highly significant after 4â€‰months of schooling and reached an effect size of about 0.20 after 1â€‰year. These findings were repeated each year and varied only slightly across family, class or school type and socio-economic level. Although schooling correlated with age, exploiting the near-orthogonal variations indicated that the gender gap increased with schooling rather than with age. These findings point to the first year of school as the time and place where a maths gender gap emerges in favour of boys, thus helping focus the search for solutions and interventions.
