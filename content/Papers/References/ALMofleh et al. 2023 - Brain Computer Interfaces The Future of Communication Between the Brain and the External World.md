> [!abstract] Abstract
> This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of research on Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and their potential applications. The objective of this study was to gather information from various sources, including journal articles, conference papers, and books, to analyze the advancements and limitations of BCIs. A systematic literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar, with specific keywords related to BCIs and their applications. The selected studies were thoroughly analyzed to identify common themes, methodologies, and key findings. The main contributions of this review include an overview of different types of BCIs, their applications in fields such as medicine, entertainment, and education, and the challenges and limitations faced by BCI technology. The findings highlight the potential of BCIs in restoring motor function, improving the quality of life for individuals with various conditions, and enhancing human-technology interaction. Furthermore, the review identifies future research directions, including signal processing improvements, exploring hybrid and multimodal approaches, conducting long-term real-world studies, addressing ethical considerations, and prioritizing user-centred design. This comprehensive analysis of existing literature provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of BCIs and sets the stage for future advancements in this rapidly evolving domain.
