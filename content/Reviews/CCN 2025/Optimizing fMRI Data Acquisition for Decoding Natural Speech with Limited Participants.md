> > it is not clear what they think the largest impact of the paper is. Is it the performance of their decoder? If so, it would be helpful to compare their performance to previously published decoders. Is the implication that more data per subject is more important for decodability than more subjects? If so, the authors should more clearly state the implications in experimental design for experimentalists. This is already done in the discussion to some extent but could be emphasized more clearly

Do they think that this could be related to their voxel selection procedure that is agnostic to anatomical or functional regions within subject? What steps do the authors think would be required to better model intersubject variability?

Our results suggest that simpler sentences with direct speech are easier to decode than narration with complex syntax. However this does not tell us which kind of sentences are the most useful to train on to reach good performance. We leave analyzing such an impact as future work, the data we have is not labeled to do training split of simple/complex sentences.
