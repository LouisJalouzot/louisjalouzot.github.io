## Tutorials

# Questions
- How does the cache validation work in exca? Have to specify versions?
	Like joblib, cache function body and clean cache when invalid?
- Do you use wandb (or equivalent) in combination with exca?
- Would you also be interested in something like scheduling based on task dependencies (like airflow, dask etc.)? To optimize computation by leveraging caching (e.g. no more worries when launching experiments/multiple configs which would require the same embeddings but differ in other parameters e.g. decoding params)
