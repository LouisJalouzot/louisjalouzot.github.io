# Data
2 sEEG recording machines:
- Neuralynx
- Blackrock
One tool/Python pipeline to read from any (maybe MNE python, interfaces with sklearn, originally for MEG/EEG but can now be used with intracranial, viz tools from nilearn)
- Single cell activity: use Yair's tool to read

# Goal
Unify all experiments to a single format: bids for intracranial (already exists for sEEG)
Hard part: keep electrode position

# Decoding
Modalities: word heard/word presented visually/word production
What can be decoded from which areas
Modality agnostic areas?

High $\gamma$ processing: keep power of high frequency signal
