# Neural tracking
- Read literature to find how they compute audio enveloppe (= RMS intensity)
	- keywords: Neural tracking, EEG, enveloppe, cocktail party
- See if we find "neural tracking" in Corentin's *distraction* LPP MEG data
	- Largest correlation between MEG and sound enveloppe in the non-distracted case
