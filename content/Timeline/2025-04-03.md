# [[Review]]
- Read and reply to the very good answers from the authors of the ACL review I did for Emmanuel ([[Analyze the Neurons not the Embeddings]])

# [[MLEM]]
- Very quick try of metabase (should also try apache superset)
- First results on relative clause comparing Spearman for the different parametrizations and FI profiles for euclidean/cosine and mean/CLS (c.f. [[Results]])
