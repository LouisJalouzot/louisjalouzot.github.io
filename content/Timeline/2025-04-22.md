# [[Review]], [[Decoding]]
- Remaking figure 6, quantitative semantics/syntax for subjects 1/2/3
- Updating caption and text for new figure 6
# [[Suffragists]]
- Changed prompt to independently parse year, month, day
- Formatting of the day would fail a lot
- Tried with 2.5 flash, which was very annoying to use
- Solved by requiring day (and all other fields) in the output
