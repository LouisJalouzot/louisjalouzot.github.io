# [[MLEM]]
- Solution to hierarchical dependencies with Pydantic classes to have exca caching:
	- Adding subclasses as attributes (even in the case `A(C,B(C))`)
	- ~~Having multiple infras~~: infra parameters duplication
	- ~~Instantiate classes in body of main class~~: Annoying to create configs (ugly dictionaries manipulation) + no more Pydantic parameter validation
- What about `A(B(D),C(D))`? Solution: 
- Reworking Pydantic classes in this regard
