# [[Suffragists]]
- Gemini structured output is fixed, running more issues with paying model
- Still getting some broken responses because of caching (fixed with very minor modification of the prompt to invalidate the caches)

# [[Decoding]] & [[Review]]
- Looking for similar work in the literature to compare to, found:
	- Generative language reconstruction from brain recordings (recently published, 01/03/2025) very good
	- Decoding Continuous Character-based Language from Non-invasive Brain Recordings (preprint)
	- Language Reconstruction with Brain Predictive Coding from fMRI Data (preprint, rejected on OpenReview)
	- BP-GPT: Auditory Neural Decoding Using fMRI-prompted LLM (preprint, seems bad)
- Read [[Papers/Notes/Ye et al. 2025 - Generative|Ye et al. 2025 - Generative]], very good, could be used as baseline
